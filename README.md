The most widely consumed vegetable in the world is the tomato. Tomatoes have been grown for several 100 years and are very prominent as a vegetable in Europe. In 2016, global production of tomatoes was 177 million and grew 33% over the 10-year period. In agriculture, tomatoes have great economic importance, especially for many European countries, for example, Italy and Spain. With the help of new technologies, tomato plants can be grown in quantities sufficient to provide food for billions of people. However, more and more plant diseases are appearing due to changing environmental conditions that threaten this supply. Every year, therefore, a large proportion of crops are lost to disease, meaning that the livelihoods of many farmers worldwide depend on how good their harvest will be. The continent Africa is particularly affected by this situation affected by this situation, as 80% of agricultural goods come from smallholder farmers.
